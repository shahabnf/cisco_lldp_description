# Cisco LLDP Description

This script will find the port number and the associated connected MAC address(es) using the "Show LLDP neighbors" command.

The next step is to create a CSV output file and sort the results alphabetically by Gigabit or TenGigabit.

At this stage, the script will create a proper description for the port to help network admins with troubleshooting.
